This project is an Arduino-based decimal to binary converter that uses a push-button to increment a decimal number (0–15) and displays its 4-bit binary equivalent using four LEDs.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- 4x LEDs
- 4x Resistors (220Ω)
- Push-button
- Breadboard & Jumper wires

## How It Works

- Press the button to increment the decimal number
- The number cycles from 0 to 15 and then resets
- The 4-bit binary representation of the current number is displayed using the LEDs

## Logic

- On every rising edge (button press), the decimal value is incremented
- A function `decimalToBinary()` converts the value to binary
- The binary output is displayed using `digitalWrite()` on four LEDs

## Pin Configuration

- LEDs: Pins 2–5
- Button: Pin 6
