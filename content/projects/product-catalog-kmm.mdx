A cross-platform mobile application built with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) that allows users to manage product catalogs efficiently. The app features local database synchronization with automatic notifications when changes are detected.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- SQLite for local database
- Local notifications for change detection
- Shared business logic across platforms

## üß† How It Works

1. Users can browse and manage product catalogs
2. Local database stores product information for offline access
3. App monitors database changes automatically
4. Local notifications alert users when database updates occur
5. No external services required - fully self-contained

## üöÄ Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase for Android and iOS
- **Offline Support**: Local SQLite database for data persistence
- **Change Detection**: Automatic monitoring of database modifications
- **Local Notifications**: Instant alerts for data changes
- **Shared Logic**: Business logic shared between platforms

## üìä Implementation

The application leverages KMM's shared code capabilities to maintain consistent functionality across Android and iOS platforms. Local database monitoring ensures users are promptly notified of any catalog updates without requiring external push notification services.
