Note Ninja is a lightweight Streamlit web application that transforms spoken notes into concise summaries. It's designed for capturing and distilling information from lectures, meetings, or impromptu thoughts when typing isn't convenient.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit for web interface
- Google Speech Recognition for transcription
- Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro) for summarization
- Streamlit Cloud for deployment

## üß† How It Works

1. Users record audio directly through the web interface or upload a `.wav` file
2. The application transcribes the speech using Google's Speech Recognition API
3. The transcript is sent to Gemini Pro AI for summarization
4. Users receive both the full transcript and a concise summary

## üöÄ Features

- **Voice Recording**: Capture audio directly in the browser
- **Audio Upload**: Support for existing `.wav` files
- **Accurate Transcription**: Convert speech to text with Google's recognition technology
- **AI Summarization**: Distill key points from lengthy transcripts
- **Simple Interface**: Minimal, user-friendly Streamlit UI

## üìä Implementation

The application combines Streamlit's audio recording capabilities with Google's speech recognition and generative AI technologies. This creates an end-to-end solution for converting spoken language into written summaries with minimal user effort.
