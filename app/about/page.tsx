                I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a deep fascination for 
                AI/ML and Android development. My journey in technology began with curiosity 
                about how things work, and it has evolved into a love for creating solutions 
                that make a difference.

                When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost in a good book, gazing at clouds, 
                or enjoying a perfect cup of espresso. These moments of reflection often inspire 
                my best ideas and keep me grounded.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I'm still learning and growing every day, and I find joy in exploring new technologies, 
                contributing to projects, and collaborating with others who share the same enthusiasm. 
                I'm especially drawn to spaces where I can both contribute and learn.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I'm always open to opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and growâ€”so if you're 
                working on something interesting, or just want to chat about the latest tech, I'd love to connect!
